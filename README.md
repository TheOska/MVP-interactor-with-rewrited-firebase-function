## MVP-interactor-with-rewrited-firebase-function
This is a rewrite of a MVP firebase on [Medium tutorial](https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/using-firebase-to-create-a-simple-chat-application-in-android-4b32fdbf565e)(Using Firebase to create a “simple” Chat application in Android), because the firebase have been changed the API, which the [original project](https://github.com/filbabic/InternalChat) is outdated. It causes the problem of registering user or other function require firebase API e.g enter the credentials on register activity will keep returning request failure toast. So I just changed the latest firebase version (currently 10.2.6) from original project and all MVP structure still keep remain unchanged.

Also keep in mind that need to create own firebase project, enable email password Auth and add the google-services.json to project folder :)
